# Asteroids3DWebGL
My html canvas game Asteroids3d converted to WebGL
###### You might notice an issue with camera rotation when your ship has done a 360 degree turn, this is because of the gimble lock problem, at the time I made this I did not use Euler coordinates for rotation. Someday I will come back and fix this.
